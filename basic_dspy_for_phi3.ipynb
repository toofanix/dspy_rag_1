       "[\" Pluto, being a dwarf planet located in our solar system's Kuiper Belt, experiences extremely harsh and cold conditions. Its average surface temperature is estimated to be around -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-225 to -240 degrees Celsius). \\n\\nThe weather on Pluto consists mostly of thin atmospheric layers made up mainly of nitrogen, with trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. The atmosphere is so tenuous that it only exerts a pressure equivalent to the difference between mountain air at sea level and top-floor altitude in tall buildings on Earth – about 1/10 millionth atmospheric pressure (approximately 2e-8 bar).\\n\\nThe weather patterns are also influenced by Pluto's elliptical orbit around the Sun, which causes seasonal changes. However, due to its great distance from the Sun and extremely low temperatures, these seasons have little effect on surface conditions compared to what we experience here on Earth. The atmosphere expands when Pluto is closest to the sun (in perihelion) and contracts as it moves away in aphelion (the farthest point), but this expansion doesn't result in significant weather changes since temperatures remain extremely cold throughout these variations.\\n\\nIn summary, the weather on Pluto would be considered extreme by Earth standards: frigidly cold with minimal atmospheric dynamics and no liquid water or surface winds as we know them.\"]"

      "2] Jean Joho | Jean Joho is a French-American chef and restaurateur. He is chef/proprietor of Everest in Chicago (founded in 1986), Paris Club Bistro & Bar and Studio Paris in Chicago, The Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Las Vegas, and Brasserie JO in Boston. \n",

The premise of the series is that within two days and on a budget of $10,000, celebrity chef Robert Irvine renovates a failing American restaurant with the goal of helping to restore it to profitability and prominence. Irvine is assisted by a designer (usually Taniya Nayak, Cheryl Torrenueva, or Lynn Keagan, but sometimes Vanessa De Leon, Krista Watterworth, Yvette Irene, or Nicole Faccuito), along with general contractor Tom Bury, who sometimes does double duty as both general contractor and designer. After assessing the problems with the restaurant, Robert Irvine typically creates a plan for the new decor, oversees the cleaning of the restaurant, reduces the size of the menu and improves the food, develops a promotional activity, educates the restaurant's owners, or trains the staff, as needed by each restaurant. \n",

He joined Colchester United in 1995 and spent seven years at Layer Road, making 226 league appearances and scoring 19 goals. Gregory helped the U\\'s to their first league promotion for 22 years in 1998 when he stepped up to put Colchester ahead from the spot in the Third Division playoff final. Gregory made history along with Neil as the first pair of brothers in a play-off final in the same match. His brother Neil joined the U\\'s in 1998 and played alongside David until 2000. Gregory featured regularly in the first team until he cracked a bone in his foot playing against Port Vale in March 2002 and failed to recover fitness by the summer break. He again teamed up with his brother Neil at Canvey Island in July 2002.»\\n[3] «Karl D. Gregory Cooperative House | Karl D. Gregory Cooperative House is a member of the Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan. The structure that stands at 1617 Washtenaw was originally built in 1909 for the Tau Gamma Nu fraternity, but was purchased by the ICC in 1995. Gregory House is the only house in the organization that is expressly substance free. No tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs are allowed on the property. Gregory House has a maximum capacity of 29 members (by way of 13 single and 8 double capacity rooms) as of June 2008.»\\n[4] «Kinnairdy Castle | Kinnairdy Castle is a tower house, having five storeys and a garret, two miles south of Aberchirder, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

It is situated in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, and is currently occupied by Scottish businesswoman Ann Gloag. The house is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.»\\n\\nQuestion: How many storeys are in the castle that David Gregory inherited?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to Kinnairdy Castle | Five storeys.\\n\\nAnswer:\\x1b[32m Five storeys.\\x1b[0m\\n\\n\\n'"
