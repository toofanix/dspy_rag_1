It experiences dramatic seasonal changes because of an axial tilt that is similar to Earth\\'s. But given its distance and orbital eccentricity, these seasons are much more prolonged with each \\'day\\', or Pluto year which lasts about 248 Earth years!\\n\\nThe surface of this dwarf planet displays a mix between ice caps (mainly nitrogen), frozen plains composed primarily of methane, carbon monoxide and possibly water. There\\'s also evidence for an atmosphere comprising mainly nitrogen with some traces of other gases like methane - although it is incredibly thin compared to our Earth!\\n\\nHowever, due to its distance from the Sun, Pluto experiences a phenomenon known as \\'atmospheric escape\\', where lighter molecules are lost into space at a rate influenced by solar wind. This means that during certain times in Pluto\\'s elliptical orbit around the sun - when it comes closest (perihelion) and further away (aphelion), its atmosphere expands or shrinks respectively, leading to fluctuations in weather patterns across this distant world.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while we can certainly say that \"weather\" on Pluto exists, our understanding of what constitutes \\'weather\\' is challenged by the extreme conditions found there and how they differ from those experienced here on Earth.']"

      "2] Jean Joho | Jean Joho is a French-American chef and restaurateur. He is chef/proprietor of Everest in Chicago (founded in 1986), Paris Club Bistro & Bar and Studio Paris in Chicago, The Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Las Vegas, and Brasserie JO in Boston. \n",

      "3] List of Restaurant: Impossible episodes | This is the list of the episodes for the American cooking and reality television series \"Restaurant Impossible\", produced by Food Network. The premise of the series is that within two days and on a budget of $10,000, celebrity chef Robert Irvine renovates a failing American restaurant with the goal of helping to restore it to profitability and prominence. Irvine is assisted by a designer (usually Taniya Nayak, Cheryl Torrenueva, or Lynn Keagan, but sometimes Vanessa De Leon, Krista Watterworth, Yvette Irene, or Nicole Faccuito), along with general contractor Tom Bury, who sometimes does double duty as both general contractor and designer. After assessing the problems with the restaurant, Robert Irvine typically creates a plan for the new decor, oversees the cleaning of the restaurant, reduces the size of the menu and improves the food, develops a promotional activity, educates the restaurant's owners, or trains the staff, as needed by each restaurant. \n",
